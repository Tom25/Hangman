## How to play
Playing this Hangman game is easy: Simply download the repository to your computer and run `hangman.py`! The game comes with its own included word list, `wordlist.txt`, which contains a list of 58,000+ English words from which the game can draw.

## Customization
Want to specify your own list of words in place of the included `wordlist.txt`? Simply overwrite that file with a text file of your own of the same filename, with each word on a separate line. Compound words with spaces involved work, too (eg., ice cream).

You can also add new words onto the included `wordlist.txt` file to be used in the game. Words can be added at any place in the file but, again, add one word per line.

## Requirements
- Have Python 3.3 installed on your computer

## Who wrote this?
The program was written by Tom Catullo (tcatullo25*{at}*gmail*{dot}*com) as a leisurely project. I was learning Python in a class and decided to apply it to a project of my own to get some experience, and to have some fun. This was the result!

## Acknowledgements
- The included graphics library, `graphics.py`, was written by John Zelle for use with the book "Python Programming: An Introduction to Computer Science" (Franklin, Beedle & Associates). *__Note:__ I only used this particular graphics library because it was included with the textbook used in my university class; however, I am aware that there are __much__ better alternatives out there.*
